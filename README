HPCStack provides the necessary updates to various build tools to
facilitate software development on RHEL / CentOS 6.5.


Hardware Requirements
=====================
This software stack requires Tesla K20 or higher GPU and Mellanox
ConnectX-3 VPI InfiniBand adapters. ConnectX-3 EN (ethernet) adapters are
not supported.


Usage
=====

First make sure you have installed these pre-requisites in this order:

0. Install RHEL/CentOS 6.5 using the Software Development Workstation option.
   Make sure to disable SELinux and iptables. Also disable IOMMU by
   adding "iommu=off intel_iommu=off" to kernel command line in
   /boot/grub/grub.conf (without the quotes).
1. EPEL rpm repository: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL
2. NVIDIA CUDA 6.0, use the RPM for RHEL 6.5 from
   https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads#linux
3. Mellanox MLNX_OFED_LINUX v2.x for RHEL 6.5 from
   http://www.mellanox.com/page/products_dyn?product_family=26&mtag=linux_sw_drivers
4. Mellanox OFED GPUDirect RDMA Beta from
   http://www.mellanox.com/page/products_dyn?product_family=116&mtag=gpudirect

After these are installed and operational you can proceed to building HPCStack.
This is done as follows:

1. cd /path/to/hpcstack
2. echo "PREFIX = /where/you/want/to/install/hpcstack" > .hpcstack_local
3. make -j

After build completes you must still add the necessary path to .bashrc or
wherever you keep them:

export PATH=/path/to/installed/hpcstack/bin:$PATH

Start a new shell and observe that for example libtool is picked up from the
correct location.

You have successfully completed HPCStack installation.
